# Sounio Language Support for VS Code

VS Code extension for the [Sounio](https://github.com/sounio-lang/sounio)
programming language — epistemic computing at the horizon of certainty.

## Features (preview)

Powered by the checked preview Language Server route (`souc lsp --stdio`):

- **Diagnostics** — type errors highlighted as you save.
- **Hover** — info on Sounio keywords, primitive types, effects, and
  stdlib functions.
- **Completion** — context-aware completions from the stdlib plus
  identifiers in the current file.
- **Go to Definition** (F12) — jump to where a name is declared.
- **Find References** (Shift+F12) — list every use of an identifier.
- **Rename Symbol** (F2) — rename across the current file with a
  workspace-edit preview.
- **Formatting** — routes through the checked `souc format` surface.
- **REPL terminal** — opens the file-backed `souc repl` preview.
- **Syntax Highlighting** — TextMate grammar covering effects, units of
  measure, refinement types, and Sounio's epistemic keywords.

## Setup

The extension spawns the Sounio compiler as a language server:

1. Install Sounio (the `souc` CLI) — see the
   [main repo](https://github.com/sounio-lang/sounio).
2. Make sure `souc` is on `PATH`, *or* set `sounio.serverPath` in your
   VS Code settings to an absolute path (e.g.
   `"/opt/sounio/bin/souc"`). An explicit setting is used as supplied; an
   unavailable executable produces a launch error. The extension does not
   search the opened project for another compiler.

The checked preview route uses the in-tree `bin/souc` wrapper. Rebuilding the
pure-Sounio server from `self-hosted/lsp/server.sio` is a separate compiler
blocker and should not be presented as green until `tools/lsp/test_protocol.sh`
or an equivalent gate passes.
